Ensuring correctness in high-performance computing (HPC) applications is one of the fundamental challenges that the HPC community faces today. While significant advances in verification, testing, and debugging have been made to isolate software errors (or defects) in the context of non-HPC software, several factors make achieving correctness in HPC applications and systems much more challenging than in general systems software—growing heterogeneity (architectures with CPUs, GPUs, and special purpose accelerators), massive scale computations (very high degree of concurrency), use of combined parallel programing models (e.g., MPI+X), new scalable numerical algorithms (e.g., to leverage reduced precision in floating-point arithmetic), and aggressive compiler optimizations/transformations are some of the challenges that make correctness harder in HPC. The following reports lay out the key challenges and research areas of HPC correctness: (1) [DOE Report of the HPC Correctness Summit](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1470989), (2) [DOE/NSF Workshop on Correctness in Scientific Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15640).


As the complexity of future architectures, algorithms, and applications in HPC increases, the ability to fully exploit exascale systems will be limited without correctness. With the continuous use of HPC software to advance scientific and technological capabilities, novel techniques and practical tools for software correctness in HPC are invaluable.

The goal of the Correctness Workshop is to bring together researchers and developers to present and discuss novel ideas to address the problem of correctness in HPC. The workshop will feature contributed papers and invited talks in this area.

###  <a class="anchor" name="submissions"> HPC Bug Fest </a>
This year again, we have the [HPC Bug Fest](https://sites.google.com/view/hpc-bugs-fest/home), a session that will focus on correctness benchmarks. The goal is to provide a detailed snapshot of the state-of-the-art HPC verification tools by both discussing their methodologies and comparing their evaluation metrics. 

This session only accepts short papers based on four different contributions: (1) 
codes to expand existing benchmarks, (2) new metrics to evaluate verification tools, (3) new results to track tools updates, and (4) 
real world cases of error correction. An artefact description is 
mandatory to ensure reproducibility. 

More information on the website: [https://sites.google.com/view/hpc-bugs-fest/home](https://sites.google.com/view/hpc-bugs-fest/home)

HPC Bug Fest papers must be submitted electronically using the "Correctness Short Papers" form at: [https://submissions.supercomputing.org/](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/).

###  <a class="anchor" name="award">Best Presentation Award</a>

Like in previous years, we will have the **Best Presentation Award**. The goal is to reward high-quality presentations, motivating speakers at the workshop to deliver their best work. We believe that advancing the field of Correctness in HPC requires more engagement and collaboration between the research, development, and applications communities, and better presentations will lead to more engaging and informative sessions. Higher quality presentations will also help us to present the benefits of Correctness methods to our sponsors. 

A high-quality presentation should present clearly the correctness problem being addressed and its impact to scientific / HPC applications, and it should be easy to follow even for attendees that are not familiar with traditional correctness methods (formal methods, verification, testing, debugging, among others). Overall the presentation should make such methods and results more accessible to the general audience of the workshop and the SC community.

Only regular papers are eligible for the Best Presentation Award (short papers are not eligible).

#### Winner

TBD


<!--

The winner of the **Best Paper Presentation Award** is the paper "Data Race Detection through Vibe Translation", 
co-authored by Jan Hueckelheim, Vimarsh Sathia, and Siyuan Brant Qian. Congratulations!
